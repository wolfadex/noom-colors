# Noom Colors

https://wolfadex.github.io/noom-colors/

A simple calculator for determining the color of a food for [Noom](https://www.noom.com/). This is **not** meant to replace Noom or its calculator, it's just a supplemental tool for Noom users and their their partners.

As the partner of someone who uses Noom, I found it difficult to shop for them and make accurate healthy choices. This tool allows me to better help them.
